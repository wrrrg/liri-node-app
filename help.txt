Welcome to Liri! This is a node app you can control from your command line to perform a few nifty Siri-like functions.

To check your last 20 tweets, type "node liri.js my-tweets"

To find some information about a movie, type "node liri.js movie-this '<name of movie>'" ( You do want to use some ''s around the movie name, but you don't actually need the <>s! Just the name of the movie will be fine).

To find some information about a song, and possibly even a short preview of it, type "node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song-name>'". (Same deal - use ''s but you don't need <>s. Also if you're having trouble finding the right song, try tossing the artist name in as well - spotify can be pretty clever when it wants to be ;-) )

To run the contents of the random.txt file, simply type "node liri.js do-what-it-says".

If you want to check the log of all of the actions you've taken thus far, you can check your log.txt right in the console by typing "node liri.js read-log".

However, if you're tired of your log.txt getting too full, you can also reset it back to empty with "node liri.js reset-log".

That's it! Have fun :)
